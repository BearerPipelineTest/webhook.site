# About Webhook.site

[![Docker Cloud Build Status](https://img.shields.io/docker/cloud/build/fredsted/webhook.site.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/fredsted/webhook.site)
[![GitHub last commit](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/fredsted/webhook.site.svg)](https://github.com/fredsted/webhook.site/commits/master)

With Webhook.site, you can easily test HTTP webhooks and other types of HTTP requests. 

A completely open-source version is available on [Github](https://github.com/fredsted/webhook.site), while https://webhook.site hosts a similar version, but with more features, some of them requiring a paid subscription.

Upon visiting the app, you get a random URL to send your requests and webhooks to, and they're all logged in the app – instantly. Check it out at [https://webhook.site](https://webhook.site).

The app was built with [Laravel](https://laravel.com) for the API and Angular.js for the frontend SPA.
