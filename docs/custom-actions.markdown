# Custom Actions

![Custom Actions editor screenshot](/images/custom-actions.png)

With Custom Actions, it is possible to create a workflow out of a set of actions that are executed whenever a Webhook.site URL receives a request or email.

Using this functionality, you can connect APIs that aren't compatible, convert a HTTP request to an email or vice versa, build workflows that would otherwise require a developer, and much, much more.

## Demo

In the following demo, webshop order details are received in a webhook. We then use Extract JSONPath and Google Sheets actions to insert their name in a Google Sheet. It also shows how variables interact with downstream actions.

## Variables

Variables are an important part of Custom Actions, and are characterized by a name surrounded by two dollar signs: `$example$`. Variables can be used in any field that has a â“¥ icon in the editor. They act as placeholders that are replaced by dynamic content as the request or email is received.

Each request or email has a set of Base Variables (see below) that contain information like the request IP, method, headers, query string values, form values and the request content. To see a list of variables, click the Variables button in the editor. Clicking on a variable copies it to the clipboard.

Many of the the available Custom Actions can register a variable during the runtime of the actions, so for example you can register the result of a JSONPath query and use it in a "Modify Response" action to make the response dynamic, or even use it to send a request to another HTTP address, and then use the response of that. Files can referred to and be used through Variables.

This works since Custom Actions are executed synchronously in a chain, sharing data as they're being executed.

The format of variables are dollar signs surrounded by a word, for example: `$example$`.

### Variable Modifiers

Adding specific suffixes to variable names will let you process the value in the following ways:

| Variable                | Example Output                                             | Description                                                                                                                           |

## Repeating Actions

Webhook.site allows some action types to be repeating, which makes Webhook.site "loop over" one or more values without needing to use scripts.

<center><iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PDNSHyhMWcQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>

Currently, repetition is only supported by the Extract JSONPath and Extract Regex action types.

Currently, the maximum amount of items that are supported is **100** to prevent abuse. This limit may be raised in the future. Items above that are ignored.

The repeating action should be ordered *before* the actions that are to be repeated. The actions that are repeated will run for each item that is extracted, using the same variable name.

## Queued Actions

By checking the *Queued* checkbox when creating a Custom Action, Webhook.site will run that specific action in a background queue (asynchronously).

This is useful when you need your Webhook.site URL to respond quickly, but your Custom Actions are taking a long time to run.

For example, if your Webhook.site URL should respond in 5 seconds, but you need to call an endpoint with a Send Request action that responds in 10 seconds, you can queue the Send Request action.

As the a queued action will inherit the execution scope up until the action, there are a few things to be aware of when using Queued Actions:

* Only variables defined in actions ordered *before* the queued action will be available to the action.
* Variables defined by a queued action is not available to actions coming *after* it. You cannot, for example, mark a *Send Request* action as queued and use the response in a *Modify Response* action.
* If you mark several Custom Actions as queued, they will execute independently and not share variables. 
* The amount of time until the queued action is executed can vary, but is usually in the order of seconds.
* If you have several actions marked as queued, it is not guaranteed that they will execute in order.
