### Custom URLs and Emails 
Get an address that's easy to remember:

`webhook.site/my-alias`

`my-alias@email.webhook.site`

(With [Webhook.site Enterprise](#enterprise-features), you can even use your own domain name.)

### Security 
Your data is secured in your account, and can be accessed by API Key or login. With the free version of Webhook.site, others can freely view the requests sent to your URL.

### Permanent URLs 
The URLs stay in your account forever, the 7-day auto expiration of the free version is removed.

### Store more than 500 requests or emails 
With the free version, URLs stop taking in new requests or emails after the 500 request limit is reached. With Pro, the limit of max 500 requests or emails per URL is removed and raised to 10.000 requests or emails, which are then rotated automatically.

### Unlimited URLs 
Create as many upgraded URLs or email addresses as you need at no extra cost.

### CSV Export 
Export all requests and emails to a CSV file.

### Email Support 
Weâ€™ll help you troubleshoot and set up your Custom Actions and workflows.


## Enterprise features

In addition to all Pro features, Enterprise also contains the following features:


### Custom Domain 
Use a your own (sub)domain for URLs and emails: 

`mydomain.com/my-alias`

`my-alias@email.mydomain.com`

Additionally, Webhook.site provides an SSL certificate which is included free of charge with your Enterprise subscription.

### Multi-User Support 
Ideal for larger organizations, share URLs, schedules, and other data with the rest of the organization. Configure individual users' access with User Types like Administrator and Viewer, so some users may only view the content.
