## 28 January 2019

* WebhookScript now supports newline literals (`\\n`) in strings, escaped by 2 backslashes.

## 25 January 2019

* Global Variables are now available in the Control Panel, which lets you keep configuration like API keys in a separate place from your Custom Actions and scripts while managing them at a central place.

* Changed the font of the WebhookScript editor, which resulted in uneven selection of text.

## 23 January 2019

* You can now specify a source variable for JSONPath and Regex actions, so you can extract text from not only the request content.
